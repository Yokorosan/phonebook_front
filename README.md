## PhoneBook Front End

This application was made using next.js and styled with Chakra.ui, most of the commands for that frameworks are valid

## To Start the development server!

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Caution

Be aware that all the requisitions are made using the axios that is located in the folder(services), before starting using the front-end please change the baseURL for your desired one, it should works without problem.

This application was made to be used together with the clientcontact_api that can be found in this repository: https://github.com/Yokorosan/clientandcontact-api

Hope you have a great day!
